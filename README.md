**Our Collaboration**

We collaborate with INSTAR Lab Inc., a renowned research institute, to leverage cutting-edge scientific methods in our incubation process.

The DROID Ops concept is now attached to the WE (World Enterprise) Business Incubator that helps build Worlds. World Enterprise (WE) has over 20 years of business experience growing companies. The World Enterprise has 5 departments/companies underneath it.
1.	HardMagic
2.	Research Tech
3.	Northern Ark
4.	Jivva
5.	Jaivai

All of them are using Droid Ops (Design, Research, Optimize, Integrate, Deliver) in their work to get successful results. 

At World Enterprise, we are committed to launching droids (projects) that evolve into worlds (companies) or join existing worlds, creating a dynamic and thriving business ecosystem. Our frameworks and methodologies ensure that each project is nurtured to its full potential, driving innovation and growth across industries.
