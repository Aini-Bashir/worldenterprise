Subject: Let's Align Your Vision with Our ORBITAL Mission Control System
 
Dear [Client's Name],
 
I hope this message finds you well.
 
We are thrilled about the potential of working together and bringing your vision to life. At World Enterprise, we believe that a clear and strategic approach is crucial for the successful incubation and launch of any project. That's why we utilize our ORBITAL Mission Control System – a comprehensive framework designed to align our efforts with your aspirations.
 
To ensure our collaboration is as effective as possible, we would like to understand the core components of your project through the lens of ORBITAL. This will help us assess how we can best support you in achieving your goals.
 
Here’s what we need to know:
 
- **O**bjective: What is the primary goal you aim to achieve with your business idea?
- **R**esources: What assets or support systems do you currently have or need?
- **B**udget: What financial plan have you allocated for this venture?
- **I**ndicators: How will you measure success along the way?
- **T**ransport: What are your plans for delivering your product or service?
- **A**ctivities: What key actions will you undertake to reach your objectives?
- **L**ogistics (or MEL Plan): How do you envision managing operations, equipment, and logistics?
 
We invite you to create a simple 1-page ORBITAL document that outlines these elements. Alternatively, if it’s more convenient for you, we’d be delighted to set up a call where we can guide you through each aspect and gather this information collaboratively.
 
Once we have these insights, our team at World Enterprise will be in an excellent position to evaluate how we can propel your project forward. Should everything align well with our capabilities and mission, we are prepared to assist in steering you towards SBIR/STTR opportunities for funding and launching your dream into reality.
 
Please let us know which option suits you best – crafting the ORBITAL document yourself or discussing it over a call. We are here to facilitate this process for you every step of the way.
 
Looking forward to embarking on this exciting journey together!
 
Warm regards,
